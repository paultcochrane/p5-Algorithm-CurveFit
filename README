Algorithm-CurveFit version 1.00
===============================

Algorithm::CurveFit implements a nonlinear least squares curve fitting
algorithm. That means, it fits a curve of known form (sine-like, exponential,
polynomial of degree n, etc.) to a given set of data points.

For details about the algorithm and its capabilities and flaws, you're
encouraged to read the following MathWorld page:
